        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Salsa rice, also known as Mexican rice, is a flavorful side dish famous for its colorful red hue. This recipe whips up in minutes thanks to instant rice and premade salsa, but if you want to go the extra mile, feel free to use regular rice and homemade salsa.</p>
        <p>Serve it alongside any number of authentic Mexican recipes, or opt for a slightly different flavor combination, pairing it with a Tex-Mex, Southwestern or even Cajun main dish like blackened shrimp. There are plenty of ways to enjoy this dish, so have fun and experiment!</p>
